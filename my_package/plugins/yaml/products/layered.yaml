# The "layered" product_inputs file provides the specifications for the final @My-Layered-Product@ output.
# The individual layers are specified within the command line call - this file indicates how the final image
# should be generated.

# @My-Layered-Product@ MUST match the fusion_final_product_name specified in the command line call.

# coverage_dataset: @fuse_dataset_name_N@
#    specifies which dataset (as specified in --fuse_dataset_name via command line) should be used
#    for calculating the final coverage of the product (for determining % coverage in filenames, and to determine
#    if the product should be produced at all).  Please choose @fuse_dataset_name_N@ from the command line call
#    appropriately (this just depends on how you want coverage defined for your final product)
# alt_varname_for_covg: @variable_from_dataset_name_N@
#    the variable you want to use from @fuse_dataset_name_N@ for calculating coverage.
# covg_func: masked_arrays
#    indicates the appropriate coverage function to use for the given dataset (ie, defining coverage for
#    windbarb data is different than for raster data).  covg_funcs are found in interface_modules/coverage_checks
# Currently there is no method for including multiple datasets in the final coverage calculation. Please let the
#    GeoIPS Team know if that is required functionality.

# product_template: "Layered"
#   indicates the base product to use in creating "@My-Layered-Product@"
#   All fields under @My-Layered-Product@ override those in data_fusion/yaml_configs/product_params/Layered.yaml
#  
# mpl_colors_info:
#   Each key within mpl_colors_info refers to a @fuse_dataset_name_N@ as defined in the test script / command line call
#   This option allows overriding fields within the current layer's colormap specification with a specific value.
#   Please see various YAML files in data_fusion/yaml_configs/product_params/Layered-*.yaml for a variety of
#   options for setting mpl_colors_info values specifically for adjusting colorbar locations/positioning
